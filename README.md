# ðŸŽ­ Eigenfaces Face Recognition using PCA

This project implements **Eigenfaces** for face recognition using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** in Python. The goal is to extract key facial features and represent them as Eigenfaces to understand and visualize how PCA captures the most important information in facial images.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project covers:
- Loading a dataset of facial images
- Preprocessing images (grayscale conversion, resizing)
- Computing the **Mean Face** from the dataset
- Applying **PCA** to extract the most important features
- Visualizing the **Eigenfaces**
